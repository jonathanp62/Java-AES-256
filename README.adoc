AES-256
-------

A program that uses AES-256 encryption and decryption for strings and files.

Configuration Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration is expressed in JSON and is supplied by default in *config/config.json*. It can be overriden with a java system property, i.e. *--Dapp.configurationFile=config/config.json*

|Key                        |Value               |Description
|cipher                     |                    |The cipher section
|cipher:character-set       |UTF-8               |The character set to use for the cipher
|cipher:instance            |AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding|The instance class for the cipher
|salter                     |                    |The salter section
|salter:character-set       |UTF-8               |The character set to use for the salt
|salter:iterations          |3                   |The number of iterations to make
|password-minimum-length    |20                  |The minimum length of a password
|pbe-key-spec-iterations    |65536               |The number of iterations to make for the PBE key spec
|pbe-key-spec-key-length    |256                 |The key length for the PBE key spec
|secret-key-factory-instance|PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256|The instance class for the secret key factory
|secret-key-spec-algorithm  |AES                 |The algorithm for the secret key

Logging
~~~~~~~

Logging is achieved using the SLF4J facade over Logback. The logging configuration is supplied in *config/logback.xml*. It can be overriden with a java system property, i.e. *-Dlogback.configurationFile=config/logback.xml*
